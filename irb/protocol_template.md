# Protocol — AI-Assisted Pediatric Screening Study

## Title

Prospective Evaluation of AI-Assisted Pediatric Screening (PediScreen AI).

## Primary Objective

Evaluate sensitivity and time-to-referral reduction versus standard screening when using AI-assisted pediatric developmental screening in [setting].

## Secondary Objectives

- Measure referral delay reduction.
- Assess bias parity across demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, language).
- Quantify clinician time saved and workflow acceptance.

## Study Design

[Prospective / Retrospective] [single-site / multi-site] [observational / interventional] study.

## Population

- **Inclusion:** Children aged 12–36 months [and other criteria].
- **Exclusion:** [List, e.g., known developmental diagnosis, non–English-speaking without interpreter, etc.]

## Primary Endpoint

Early identification rate difference (AI-assisted arm vs. standard-of-care arm) [or protocol-specific definition].

## Secondary Endpoints

- Referral delay (days from positive screen to referral).
- Bias parity (sensitivity/specificity by subgroup).
- Clinician time per screening (minutes).
- System usability and acceptability (e.g., SUS, custom survey).

## Interventions / Procedures

- **AI-assisted arm:** Clinician uses PediScreen AI (MedGemma/MedSigLIP-based) as decision support; workflow per site SOP.
- **Control (if applicable):** Standard screening only.
- Data collection: [demographics, screening results, referrals, timestamps, optional surveys].

## Statistical Analysis

[Sample size justification, primary analysis (e.g., superiority/non-inferiority), subgroup analyses, handling of missing data.]

## Data Management and Security

See attached **Data Security Plan**. All PHI encrypted at rest and in transit; access logged; de-identification for analysis per protocol.

## Regulatory and Compliance

- FDA: PediScreen AI is [SaMD / under development]; [510(k) / study device status].
- NIST 800-53 / HIPAA: Controls implemented as per compliance matrix and evidence report.
