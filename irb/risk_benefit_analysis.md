# Risk–Benefit Analysis — PediScreen AI Research

## Benefits

- **To participants/society:** Potential for earlier identification of developmental concerns; reduction in referral delay; more consistent application of screening criteria.
- **To science:** Evidence on real-world performance of AI-assisted pediatric screening; data on fairness and bias; input to regulatory and clinical guidelines.

## Risks

- **Privacy/confidentiality:** Unauthorized access or breach of PHI. *Mitigation:* Encryption, access controls, audit, compliance with NIST/HIPAA; see Data Security Plan.
- **Psychological:** Anxiety from screening process or results. *Mitigation:* Standard counseling and referral pathways; clear communication in consent.
- **Bias/discrimination:** AI may perform differently across subgroups. *Mitigation:* Bias monitoring (fairness metrics), transparency, and ongoing evaluation; see regulatory and telemetry (e.g., BiasDashboard, fairness.py).
- **Operational:** Reliance on AI could delay or miss referrals if tool fails. *Mitigation:* AI as decision support, not replacement for clinician judgment; fallback and escalation procedures; monitoring and post-market surveillance.

## Risk Level

Overall risk is assessed as [minimal / low / moderate]. Justification: [brief summary].

## Risk Minimization

- Protocol design (e.g., AI in support role only).
- Data security plan and compliance controls.
- Monitoring, incident response, and IRB reporting.
