## PediScreen AI — High-Level Architecture Diagram

This file is a placeholder for an architecture diagram asset (e.g. `.png` exported from a diagramming tool).

For now, see the ASCII and Mermaid diagrams in:

- `README.md` (system overview, model lineage)
- `docs/architecture.md` (end-to-end system design)
- `docs/model_architecture.md` (model-layer and agent topology)

When preparing for external review (e.g., Kaggle writeup, clinical validation packet, or investor deck), export a canonical diagram (PNG or SVG) and link it from this file.
