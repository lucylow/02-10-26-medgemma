# PediScreen AI — Workflow Efficiency & Clinical Impact

PediScreen AI doesn’t add steps to clinical workflows — it removes them. By shifting developmental screening upstream and automating documentation, the system allows clinicians to focus their time on evaluation and communication rather than administration.

## 🏗️ Streamlined Workflow: Before vs. After

### ❌ Traditional Workflow (High Friction)
1. **Parent arrives** at the clinic.
2. **Paper / portal intake**: Parent fills out forms in the waiting room (10–15 min).
3. **Clinician reviews intake**: Sifting through paper or unstructured text (3–5 min).
4. **Verbal questions**: Clinician re-asks developmental questions to verify (5–7 min).
5. **In-visit observation**: Attempting to capture behaviors in a stressful environment (5–8 min).
6. **Explanation to parent**: Brief summary due to time pressure (5–7 min).
7. **Manual documentation**: Typing SOAP notes from memory or scribbles (5–10 min).
8. **Decision**: Follow-up or referral based on limited, hurried data.

**Total clinician time: 23–37 minutes**

### ✅ PediScreen AI Workflow (Streamlined & Safe)
1. **Upstream screening**: Parent completes activities and observations at home before the visit.
2. **AI Analysis**: AI generates a structured draft report, flags safety concerns, and prepares visual comparisons. (Status: `REQUIRES_REVIEW`)
3. **Clinical Review**: Clinician reviews the concise dashboard and visual evidence (1–2 min).
4. **Focused discussion**: Clinician asks targeted follow-up questions during the visit (3–5 min).
5. **Human Sign-Off**: Clinician modifies the draft as needed and clicks "Sign Off". (Status: `SIGNED_OFF`)
6. **Automated delivery**: Only after sign-off, the parent-friendly explanation is delivered to the family. (Status: `DELIVERED`)
7. **EHR Integration**: Signed-off report is automatically formatted for EHR insertion (1–2 min).

**Total clinician time: 11–20 minutes**

**⏱️ Net clinician time saved: 10–15+ minutes per screening visit.**

## 💰 Economic Impact: ROI for Clinics

Based on a typical pediatric clinic performing 12 screenings per day:

| Metric | Pediatrician ($150/hr) | NP / PA ($90/hr) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Daily Time Saved** | 2.4 Hours | 2.4 Hours |
| **Daily Cost Savings** | $360 | $216 |
| **Annual Savings (240 days)** | **~$86,000** | **~$52,000** |

*PediScreen AI pays for itself by returning clinician time back to patient care.*

## 🚀 Why It Works: 9 Core Workflow Pillars

1.  **Moves screening upstream**: Data arrives before the appointment. Clinicians start visits already informed.
2.  **Structured data vs. Unstructured intake**: Replaces paper forms with standardized inputs and domain-level summaries.
3.  **One-screen clinical summary**: A single dashboard with key domains, confidence indicators, and visual references.
4.  **Reduces unnecessary referrals**: Flags when monitoring is reasonable, supporting "wait and see" with evidence.
5.  **Automates documentation**: Generates EHR-ready language, reducing charting time significantly.
6.  **Enables asynchronous collaboration**: Facilitates pre-visit review and secure sharing across care settings.
7.  **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Enforcement**: Ensures no AI output reaches parents without explicit clinical sign-off, maintaining safety and trust.
8.  **Longitudinal tracking**: Automatic history and trend visualization without manual comparison.
9.  **Works across settings**: Same flow in clinics, schools, and community programs with minimal retraining.
10. **Clear boundaries**: By not diagnosing, it fits cleanly into existing workflows and avoids regulatory delays.
