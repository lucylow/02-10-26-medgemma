# Parent-Facing FAQ — PediScreen AI

Use these Q/A pairs in consent dialogs, tooltips, emails, and FAQ sections. Keep language simple, empathetic, and non-technical.

---

## Q: Will the AI diagnose my child?

**A:** No. The AI produces a draft summary to help clinicians. Only a clinician can diagnose or recommend treatment.

---

## Q: Is my child's photo safe?

**A:** Yes — photos are optional, stored securely, and personally identifying details are removed before any model processing unless you explicitly consent otherwise.

---

## Q: Can I opt out of data sharing for research?

**A:** Yes — consent options let you choose whether de-identified data may be used to improve the system.

## Microcopy Variants (for different contexts)

### One-liner (badges / tiny UI elements)
We use a privacy-first AI tool to help clinicians summarize screenings. Your child's clinician reviews every report.

### Short paragraph (consent modal intro)
PediScreen helps your child's healthcare team by creating a clear, easy-to-read screening summary. The tool uses secure, private methods and does not provide a diagnosis. A clinician will review the draft and share any recommended next steps with you.

### Medium paragraph (FAQ / more detail)
We use an AI tool to help organize the information you provide and suggest items for clinicians to review. This helps clinicians spend more time talking with families and less time on paperwork. We redact personal identifiers before any external processing, and clinicians must review and sign the final report before it's used in care. You can opt out of sharing images or of using non-identifiable data for model improvement.

### Long friendly explanation (email or printable handout)
**Why we use AI in screening**

Our goal is to give your child the best possible support while saving time for the people caring for them. When you share observations or a photo, PediScreen AI creates a draft summary that highlights areas the clinician may want to focus on. The tool helps organize information — it does not replace a clinician's judgment. We take privacy seriously: we remove identifying details before any outside processing, protect data with encryption, and only keep data if you consent. The clinician will review the draft, discuss the findings with you, and decide any next steps together.
