# PediScreen AI — Validation Targets & Thresholds
# Source: PediScreen vs ROP AI Models comparison (Feb 2026)
# Used for validation gates, reporting, and CI checks

# Primary accuracy targets (PediScreen published targets)
accuracy:
  sensitivity:
    target: 0.96
    ci_95: [0.93, 0.98]
    min_gate: 0.93  # Lower CI bound must meet minimum
  specificity:
    target: 0.82
    ci_95: [0.78, 0.86]
    min_gate: 0.78
  ppv:
    target: 0.65
    min_gate: 0.55  # Estimated; screening accepts lower PPV
  npv:
    target: 0.98
    ci_95: [0.97, 0.99]
    min_gate: 0.97  # Critical for screening (rule-out)

# Safety-critical (non-negotiable)
safety:
  false_negative_rate_max: 0.02   # ≤2% (3x better than ROP AI 6-12%)
  high_risk_fn_count_max: 0       # No false "on_track" for refer cases
  safety_agent_recall_min: 1.0    # 100% (catches harmful language)

# Clinician agreement (AI vs gold standard)
clinician_agreement:
  cohen_kappa_min: 0.70
  target: 0.78  # PediScreen targeted; ROP AI 75-82%
